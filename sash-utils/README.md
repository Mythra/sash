# Sash-Utils #

Sash-Utils are a series of utilities specifically built for SASH. These APIs
should not be dependened on outside of sash, as they can change/remove/break at
any point in time without warning.

Below is a description of each file.

## choices.sh ##

Choices.sh is a small wrapper around the choices for sash. Specifically things
like getting multiline input, and choosing from a list of options.

## colors.sh ##

Colors.sh provides some constants for color'd logging.

## dirs.sh ##

Dirs.sh provides a place to hang directory code that doesn't really fit
anywhere else.

## sash-utils.sh ##

Sources all of the other scripts.
